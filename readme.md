## Description

_A basic RPG-style game using webpack. There isn't any character creation, just some defaults._

Specs:
1. should take character and enemy data and store it
  input: 
    stats(12, 10, 8)
    character("Cecil", "Waterbender", Stats)
    enemyStats(randomly generated)
    enemy("Enemy", "Firebender", enemyStats)
  output: character data, enemy data
2. should roll a number and add it to certain derived stats
  input:
    stats(12, 10, 8)
    stats class then calculates the derived stats directly inside its constructor: 120, 100, 80
    a number between 1 and 20 (inclusive) is generated by the roll
    Chi is used on the attack roll and is added to the roll
  output: 7+100 = 107
3. should then take the rolled number and subtract the enemy's defense
  input: 
    stats(12, 10, 8)
    enemyStats(13, 8, 10)
    7+100 = 107
    enemy's resistance: 100
  output: 107 - 100 = 7
4. should see what one character has lost all health and declare a winner
  input: 
    enemy and player stats, as above
    then, the player presses the 'attack' button, which performs the actions described in the last spec for both sides of the battle
  output: one side or the other wins, and a message is displayed.



Stages: 
0. Character types, attributes, names
1. Battle system
  0. Basic dice rolling, with some part of attributes added
  1. Derived stats from main stats, so that the player has HP and all that
  1.5. Basic system in place for rolling and damage
  2. Add a basic, rule-based computer opponent 
  3. Determine a winner after either side's health reaches 0
  4. Display the above on the page (done to this point)
